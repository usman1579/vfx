VFX - Mobile developer Challenge - React Native

TASk :

• You should code in React Native : DONE

• Feel free to use the best architecture that you think fits this kind of project :
Approach Used Component Base

• Use Redux for state management : Yes USED ReduxUIKit to manage global state managment and thunk as a middleware to access third party APIs.

• You should handle the error and no data cases in a proper way : Handle All the Errors.

• Use your imagination to implement a good UI/UX experience for the user.
Try to implement Simple and clear UI and easy to use

• You are free to use 3rd party libraries as you see fit. However it is expected from you to
explain why you use them.

• Unit tests are mandatory : UNIT TEST for Componets Completed

• We prefer small commits with good descriptions instead of huge commits : Implement Small Commits on Github.

Third party Used :
axio 
react-native-chart-kit (To Chart UI)
react-native-config    (For sensitive Data)
react-native-vector-icons (to SHow icons)


For Unit Test :
@testing-library/react-native
enzymes
jest


NOTE : 
API_KEY is free which is limited to 25 hits per day so i use mock data to show the results.




This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
